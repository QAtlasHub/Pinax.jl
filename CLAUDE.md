# CLAUDE.md — Pinax.jl

**The artifact / report layer above the HPC compute stack** (ParamIO → DataVault →
ParallelManager → **Pinax**). One presentation-neutral doc → three backends. Its job in the
workflow: turn results — including a finished `DataVault` sweep, via `report` — into a **human
gallery** *and* an **LLM-readable `agent.json`**. The LLM-facing seam of the whole pipeline is
`agent.json` (data, not pixels). See [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) for the compute stack.

## The two faces — human vs LLM (the point of the agent backend)

The same doc has **two representations, chosen by who reads it** — neither is a downgrade:

- **Human → the gallery (pixels).** A plot is the *right* human view: you read a curve's shape and
  scan a dozen panels at a glance. `:gallery` (interactive HTML) and `:latex` (print) are the human
  faces.
- **LLM → `agent.json` (data).** An LLM reasons over *numbers* far more precisely than over pixels —
  it cannot read a value off a chart, and image tokens are costly + non-deterministic. So
  `figure_as_table` presents each `@figure` **AS its plotted-data table**: the LLM gets the numbers
  (cheap inline preview + full CSV via the MCP `get_figure_data`), not the image.

`@table`, `@desc`/`@caption`, comments, `status`, and a `@benchmark`'s **verdict** flow to **both**
faces from one source. This duality — *figure for humans, data for LLMs, single source* — is why the
agent backend exists; the `@benchmark` verdict is its sharpest case: a human scans a colored
test-report, an LLM reads a machine-checkable `PASS/FAIL` instead of trusting a `println`. Keep it
when adding any node type: it needs a human render **and** an agent-data form.

## Role / public API — the seam

- **Build a doc** (macros populate an implicit global document): `@pinaxsetup` ·
  `@part`/`@page`/`@section` (structure; `@page status=:trial|:final`) · `@figure` (a deferred
  `plot(...)` / Makie scene / image path) · `@caption`/`@desc` (markdown+math) · `@table` (a
  sibling to figures) · `@benchmark`/`@expect` (a **test set**: `@expect got=… want=… tol=…` ⇒
  PASS/FAIL checks grouped into a verdict; tolerance is relative by default, `want=0` is a residual)
  · `@raw` (HTML escape hatch).
- **Render** `render(; out, theme=:gallery|:agent|:latex)` — one doc, three backends:
  `:gallery` (self-contained HTML notebook), `:agent` (`agent.json` + `agent.md`, the LLM view),
  `:latex`. Optional `vault=`/`study=` wires DataVault in (cache tracks the data's `.done`
  fingerprint; provenance recorded).
- **Bridge a sweep** `report(vault, recipe; title, out)` — discover the vault's `:done` keys, load
  each Dict, hand the `(key, dict)` pairs to a project `recipe` (which builds the doc), render
  gallery + agent.json. Driver project-independent; only `recipe` is project-specific.
  `sweep_mean(pairs, quantity, axis)` is a generic scalar-vs-swept-param reduction.

## Contracts that trip up callers — read this

- **`@figure`'s expression is DEFERRED** — captured, not run, until `render` (so structure is
  cheap and figures cache). The cache keys on code + `params` (+ the `.done` fingerprint when a
  `vault` is given).
- **`agent.json` is the neutral LLM seam** (the data face above) that pinax-mcp, registries
  (Archeion), and LLMs all read — treat its shape as a contract, not an internal detail.
- **`status` is a maturity tag a registry interprets:** `:final` (curated) vs `:trial` (raw
  experiment notebook — what `report` auto-output usually is). Pinax only carries it.
- **A `@benchmark` page emits a `verdict` block in `agent.json`** — `{verdict:"PASS|FAIL", passed,
  total, failed, checks:[{id,got,want,delta,tol,kind,pass}]}` — the machine-checkable gate that
  replaces "the benchmark *seems* to pass". `@expect` **errors** on a non-finite `got`/`want`, a
  non-positive `tol`, or `kind=:rel` with `want=0`, so `delta` is always a JSON number.
- **Two-env reality:** Pinax needs a plotting backend (Plots/Makie, heavy); compute needs its own
  heavy deps (ITensorMPS, …). They don't share an env in practice — compute writes a `DataVault`
  (or CSV), Pinax reads it. On HPC this maps to compute-node vs login-node; the seam is the vault.
- **pinax-mcp is a SEPARATE PROCESS** (`npx pinax-mcp --agent <out>`), not a Julia import. The
  neutral seam is the `agent.json` contract, not a repo/language boundary (it lives in
  `clients/pinax-mcp/` of this repo so emitter + schema co-evolve).

## Where to look for usage

- `test/test_datavault.jl` — the `report(vault, recipe)` bridge end-to-end.
- `test/test_agent.jl`, `test/test_table.jl` — the agent backend + `@table` / figure-as-table.
- `test/test_benchmark.jl` — `@expect`/`@benchmark` (the verdict contract + the fixed test-report).
- `ext/PinaxDataVaultExt.jl` / `PinaxParamIOExt.jl` — the DataVault/ParamIO seams (vault → doc,
  DataKey → stable figure id).
- `notes/00–11` (gitignored, Japanese OK) — the design spec.

## Invariants when changing this package

- **All shipped code comments & docstrings are ENGLISH** (notes/ may be Japanese).
- **Format in a clean env with JuliaFormatter v2** (`Pkg.activate(mktempdir()); Pkg.add(name="JuliaFormatter", version="2"); format(".")`) — the default env's stale formatter diverges from CI.
- CI gates **every** PR: `FormatCheck` (v2, no auto-fix) + `VersionCheck` (bump `Project.toml`) +
  Documentation/preview. Bump the Julia version even for a Node-only `clients/pinax-mcp` change.
- **Keep the `agent.json` contract stable** — it is the seam the MCP server, registries (Archeion),
  and LLMs depend on. Evolve emitter (`themes/agent.jl`) + consumer schema (`clients/pinax-mcp`) +
  the shared fixture together, in one PR.
